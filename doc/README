----------------------------
The DBI Content Review Date extension allows a review date to be set for 
specific content objects.  When this date is reached an alert email will
be sent to both the owner and the last modifier.

Certain parts of this extension are based on the hide cronjob that is
delivered with eZ publish by default.

Usage
-----

Configuration is similar to the configuration of the hide cronjob. Use the
[ReviewNotification] group in dbi_contentreviewdate.ini and consult the
following resources for more information:

- http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_9/features/cronjobs/the_cronjob_scripts#hide
- http://ez.no/doc/ez_publish/technical_manual/3_9/reference/configuration_files/content_ini/hidesettings

Also set up a cron to fire each day, something like:
40 6 * * * www-data cd /var/www/yoursite; /usr/bin/php runcronjobs.php -q contentreviewnotifiy 2>&1 > /dev/null

Besides the different group name, the HideDateAttributeList setting has also
been renamed to ReviewDateAttributeList.

The contentreviewnotify cronjob script will check the specified objects and
send out an e-mail to both the owner and the last modifier. If one of them
does not exist anymore on the site or is disabled, the e-mail will also be
sent to the fallback e-mail address specified by the [ReviewNotification]
FallbackEmail setting.

The template used to provide the body for the e-mail is located at
design/standard/templates/cronjobs/contentreviewnotify.tpl. The template
receives a variable called "node". If you set a variable named 'subject' in
the root namespace of the template, then it will be used as the subject of
the e-mail. Otherwise a default subject "Content review needed" will be used
instead.


Example code to set a custom subject:

{set scope=root $subject=concat($node.class_name, ' is due for review')}
or
{set-block scope=root variable=subject}{$node.class_name} is due for review{/set-block}

The following override conditions are available to override the mail template:

- object: ID of the object
- node: ID of the node
- parent_node: ID of the parent node
- class: ID of the content class of the object
- class_identifier: identifier of the content class of the object
- depth: depth of the node
- url_alias: URL alias of the node
- class_group: ID of the class group
